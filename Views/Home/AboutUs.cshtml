        Hello, I'm David, a graduate student in the business analytics program with the University of South Florida. Along with my finance undergrad,
        i'll be looking to obtain a business analyst role within corporate finance, where I can bring data driven solutions to operation inefficiencies
        and profit hinderences, through data modeling and visualizations. For this assignment I implemented the overall design and style of
        the web pages and constructing the about us and home page, along with helping build and implement the data chart and all web page images

        Hello, I'm Dylan Stewart. I am a graduate student in the Business Analytics and Information Systems program at the University of South Florida,
        the same school and program where I completed my undergrad, trying to continue to refine my skills to land a job in the data analytics field. I was 
        the team lead on this project and was involved in the techinical aspects of pulling and saving data from the api, as well as creating the master/detail
        data pages and the chart.js. This was a tough but rewarding project as it required lots of time and energy but I am really proud of the work we did.
