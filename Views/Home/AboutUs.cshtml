        Hello, my name is David, I’m currently a graduate student in the Business Analytics program with the University of South Florida. By having an undergraduate degree
        in Finance I’m looking to obtain a Business Analyst role, hopefully within the realm of financial markets or corporate finance, where I can understand the root of
        operation inefficiencies, improve processes, and profitability through data driven models and visualizations.

        Hello, I'm Dylan Stewart. I am a graduate student in the Business Analytics and Information Systems program at the University of South Florida,
        the same school and program where I completed my undergrad, trying to continue to refine my skills to land a job in the data analytics field. I love
        working with data and information and trying to find the stories and value hidden inside. I was the project lead for this assignment and my main tasks
        were making sure each task was delegated and accounted for as well as contributing to each aspect of the pages.
